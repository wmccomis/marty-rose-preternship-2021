Notre Dame Data Structures Spring 2021 Marty Rose Google Team

Luke Marushack, William McComis, and Luis Sosa Manubes 

This project increased our understanding of the need for algorithms that can efficiently balance the load between thousands of computing cores. This project utilized python and Linux tools to demonstrate our rudimentary load-balance algorithm on a Linux VM.


Replication Document from Google Docs:

Clone git repository
  Create a folder where you would like to store the git directory repository
    Example: “mkdir folder_name”
  Cd into it
    “cd folder_name”
  Clone the repository by running the following commands
    “git clone https://github.com/wmccomis/marty-rose-preternship-2021”
  Cd into your newly created folder of the name “marty-rose-preternship-2021”
    “cd marty-rose-preternship-2021”

Run: run the following commands
  “./overflow.py”

Note: the shebang line at the beginning of the arguments work with the computers of the software engineers. If when you try to run overflow.py you obtain the following error:
  “bad interpreter: No such file or directory”
You may need to edit the first line of the code (the shebang) to match your system.

Note: the results can only be replicated on a server with more than sixteen cores.
